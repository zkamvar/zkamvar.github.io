      <description>Positive Contact This version of poppr is a direct result of feedback that was prompted by my own feedback.
I‚Äôm always grateful for eagle-eyed users of poppr who report when things are going awry. Recently, I had noticed that poppr was cited in a recent review on the analysis of polyploid genetic data (Meirmans, Liu, and Tienderen 2018) that highlighted some limitations with established methods, including Bruvo‚Äôs distance (Bruvo et al.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I wanted to explore assembling 55 genomes of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum to check for structural rearrangements that could be caused by sub-lethal fungicide exposure. I figured the best way to do this was to assemble these genomes de novo as opposed to aligning them to a reference. This brought me to installing the ABySS de novo assembler on the HCC Tusker Cluster‚Ä¶ and I can happily report, that after half a day of command line bullshittery1, I had ABySS up and running üëç.</description>

      <description>As I was preparing to push a new version of poppr to CRAN , this tweet (appropriately) came across my feed:
Mistakes happen in science. What matters is what you do next. Anyone want to share a story of a mistake &amp;amp; how they handled it?
&amp;mdash; Adrienne Porter Felt (@__apf__) September 10, 2017  The reason I was updating poppr was to fix a mistake I had made a few years ago.</description>
