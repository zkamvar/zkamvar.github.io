      <description>My R package poppr hit over 20,000 downloads on CRAN. I thought this would be a nice opportunity to briefly talk about what initiated the development. Before that, let’s look at the cumulative number of downloads:
CRAN you dig it? Thanks to the fantastic cranlogs package, assessing the download history of a package is quite simple (with the caveat that these are logs from the rstudio mirror, so the value is almost always lower than the true value).</description>

      <title>Recreating Figure 3</title>

      <description>Motivation In February of 2016, I got an email asking if I could provide the code to recreate figure three from my article in Phytopathology on the outbreak of Phytophthora ramorum in Curry County OR from 2001 to 2014 (paywalled, but you can find a copy here).
While I have the code used for the analysis on github, it’s a lot of stuff to sort through, considering that it was my first foray in attempting a reproducible analysis, so for this post, I’m going to recreate it using current tools.</description>
