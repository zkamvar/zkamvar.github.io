      <description>I started writing in R before the tidyverse became a thing and I never really had to think about non-standard evaluation when writing functions. Those days are long past and I‚Äôve recently struggled with the challenge when writing functions for the R4EPIs project, which would stick out like ugly little trolls along side tidyverse functions.
One of my biggest struggles was trying to figure out how, excactly to select a varaible from a user as either a character string or a bare variable.</description>

      <title>Things I Learned About 2-Factor Authentication on GitHub</title>

      <description>Since the end of 2018, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a part of a collaboration between RECON and MSF called the R4EPIs initiative where we are trying to integrate a more standardized workflow of R for field epidemiologists so that it can be more cost-effective (no license fees) and troubleshooting among epidemiologists can be more effective. We have a repository to host templates for automated situation reports at https://github.com/R4EPI/sitrep. When we created the GitHub organisation, we wanted to make sure that the code being submitted to the repository was genuinely authored by the person and didn&amp;rsquo;t contain malware from a hijacked account1, so we required 2-factor authentication for the R4EPI github organisation from the start.</description>

      <description>My package, poppr, has been on CRAN for over six years now and it has received more than 400 citations and just north of 70,000 downloads from the RStudio cran mirror. I can think of three reasons why this package has been successful:
 Our lab gave several workshops using our package over the years We have written extensive documentation with both web site and package documentation. I actively maintain and answer the vast majority of questions that appear on the poppr google group.</description>

      <title>Splitting Hairs: *poppr* version 2.7</title>

      <description>Positive Contact This version of poppr is a direct result of feedback that was prompted by my own feedback.
I‚Äôm always grateful for eagle-eyed users of poppr who report when things are going awry. Recently, I had noticed that poppr was cited in a recent review on the analysis of polyploid genetic data (Meirmans, Liu, and Tienderen 2018) that highlighted some limitations with established methods, including Bruvo‚Äôs distance (Bruvo et al.</description>

      <title>Poppr 2.6.0: Better Network Plotting</title>
      <link>https://zkamvar.github.io/blog/poppr-2-6-0-better-network-plotting/</link>

      <guid>https://zkamvar.github.io/blog/poppr-2-6-0-better-network-plotting/</guid>
      <description>Poppr version 2.6.0 has officially been released on CRAN and should be built for all operating systems within the next few days üéâ. You can check out the NEWS for full details. This release features a new function called boot.ia() to assess how the Index of Association responds to repeat observations (clones). Perhaps the biggest feature is the change in how minimum spanning networks are plotted.
Minimum spanning networks were originally implemented in poppr by Javier Tabima and I, and since then they‚Äôve gone through some tweaking, eventually including features like reticulation of equivalent paths and a GUI to help construct these networks.</description>

      <title>Using a custom library in R</title>

      <description>I‚Äôve been using a custom library for R since 2012 and I‚Äôve never looked back. I‚Äôve not seen many tutorials for people do do this through R, so I figured I‚Äôd write a quick one.
Where does your R package library live? You can usually find this out by typing .libPaths() in your R console. If you have an out-of-the-box installation, it will generally be somewhere like:

      <title>Installing the ABySS</title>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I wanted to explore assembling 55 genomes of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum to check for structural rearrangements that could be caused by sub-lethal fungicide exposure. I figured the best way to do this was to assemble these genomes de novo as opposed to aligning them to a reference. This brought me to installing the ABySS de novo assembler on the HCC Tusker Cluster‚Ä¶ and I can happily report, that after half a day of command line bullshittery1, I had ABySS up and running üëç.</description>

      <description>As I was preparing to push a new version of poppr to CRAN , this tweet (appropriately) came across my feed:
Mistakes happen in science. What matters is what you do next. Anyone want to share a story of a mistake &amp;amp; how they handled it?
&amp;mdash; Adrienne Porter Felt (@__apf__) September 10, 2017  The reason I was updating poppr was to fix a mistake I had made a few years ago.</description>

      <description>My R package poppr hit over 20,000 downloads on CRAN. I thought this would be a nice opportunity to briefly talk about what initiated the development. Before that, let‚Äôs look at the cumulative number of downloads:
CRAN you dig it? Thanks to the fantastic cranlogs package, assessing the download history of a package is quite simple (with the caveat that these are logs from the rstudio mirror, so the value is almost always lower than the true value).</description>

      <title>Recreating Figure 3</title>

      <guid>https://zkamvar.github.io/blog/recreating-figure-3/</guid>
      <description>Motivation In February of 2016, I got an email asking if I could provide the code to recreate figure three from my article in Phytopathology on the outbreak of Phytophthora ramorum in Curry County OR from 2001 to 2014 (paywalled, but you can find a copy here).
While I have the code used for the analysis on github, it‚Äôs a lot of stuff to sort through, considering that it was my first foray in attempting a reproducible analysis, so for this post, I‚Äôm going to recreate it using current tools.</description>
